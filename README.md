About:</br>
Everybody knows this game from childhood. This is the game, where the price of a mistake is too high: it usually costs you the game. You can become a real master of this game by mastering only one possible option, so it also teaches you that simple is always better than complex. What’s the game? Yes, this is Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. It’s meant to be a paper game, but we are programmers, so why not make a game by ourselves? Let’s get started!</br>
Result:</br>
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and functions, handling errors and processing user input. You will Learn OOP in the process.
